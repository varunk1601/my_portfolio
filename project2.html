      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the Employee Database Management system, including front-end and back-end integration.</p>

      <h3>Technologies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT):</strong> For building the front-end interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Java:</strong> As the core programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>Hibernate:</strong> For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring Beans:</strong> For dependency injection and managing business logic.</li>
        <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> As the backend relational database to store employee data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on developing an employee database management system that allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records. The database stores key information such as Employee ID, Name, Salary, Age, and Gender. This system is designed to manage employee data efficiently and can scale for large enterprises.</p>

      <p>The integration of Hibernate for ORM with MySQL ensures smooth data access, while Spring Beans help manage the business logic seamlessly. The front-end was built using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) for an interactive and responsive user experience. Java ties all these components together as the core programming language.</p>
